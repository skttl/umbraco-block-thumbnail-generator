## Web Components

The project consists of several web components, all prefixed with `umbthumb-` to avoid naming conflicts:

- `umbthumb-image-uploader`: Main component that orchestrates the entire interface
- `umbthumb-upload-area`: Handles file upload and canvas display
- `umbthumb-color-controls`: Manages background, tint, and fit mode settings
- `umbthumb-download-controls`: Handles image export in various formats

## Usage

### Fit Modes

The component supports two fit modes for image display:

- **Fit to Width**: Image will fit the full width of the canvas. If the image is taller than the canvas, it will be anchored to the top.
- **Fit to Height**: Image will fit the full height of the canvas. If the image is wider than the canvas, it will be anchored to the left.
